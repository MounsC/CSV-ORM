This project is an implementation of an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) in C# that uses CSV files as data storage. 
It allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on entities, with support for relationships and integrity constraints.

Note: **This project is not intended for production use. It was created as a personal challenge.**
